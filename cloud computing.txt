need to buy more server // depends on traffic
need to monitor and maintain them
--> setup is expensive

no more buying expensive servers
**(scalability) --> your server capacity will vary according to traffic
your cloud provider will manage servers, hence no worries about underlying infrastructure

Cloud Computing:
it is the use of remote servers on internet to --> store, manage and process data rather than a local server(or personal computer)
IAAS  infrastructure as a service
SAAS  s/w as a service 
PASS  platform as a service

deployment models (public cloud), (private cloud - virtual), (hybrid)

iaas --> provides virtualized computing resources over internet, no physical machine, (abstract users from machines)

paas --> no control over underlying archtecture (os, storage, servers)
cloud provides customers the ability to deploy a application using a prog. lang. 

saas --> cloud provider leases applications/s/ws to clients (owned by cloud)

Cloud computing advantages:
Access anywhere, MaintenanceFree, Better security, Fast implementation, instant scalability(easy)
