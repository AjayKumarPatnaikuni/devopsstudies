Chef is an automation platform that configures and manages a company infrastructure
Chef transforms infrastructure into code 
Chef framework is a combination of chef server, nodes and workstation .
Chef server manages the nodes that make up the infrastructure

Chef-client - is a program runs on each node
Knife - command line tool runs on workstation
Chef server containes configuration information called cookbooks

CHEF RESOURCEES
1. deployment // applications //like tomcat build webserver, web application (java application)
2. webserver //nginix[open source]<-->apache, http
3. patching //updating from java 1.8 to 1.9
4. package management // install/uninstall/remove/update
5. service
6. file/directory resource
7. user management
8. nodes // docker container bootstrap

chef-client --local-mode --runlist "recipe[tomcat7]"

*********what is chef*****************
***powerful automation platform that provides a way to transforms infrastructure into code.

is a tool where we can write scripts that are used to automate processes

architecture: it consist of
chef server : Centralized store of infrastructure configuration
chef Workstation : knife is used to upload conf changes to server // a local chef repo
chef node : (systems managed by chef), chef client runs on node, retrieving configuration info from server

///// knife used to communicate with nodes (ssh)
*************
*********what is resource******************
A Resource represents a piece of infrastructure and its desired state, such as a package that should be installed, a service that should be running, or a file that should be generated

A block of Resource can be considered as a Recipe.

*************what is recipe**************
A Recipe is a collection of Resources that describes a particular configuration or policy.

*************what is a node***********
A Node represents a server and is typically a virtual machine, container instance, or physical server – basically any compute resource in your infrastructure that is *managed by Chef*.

************* How does a Cookbook differ from a Recipe in Chef?********
a recipe is a collection of resources, and primarily configures  a software package of some piece of infrastructure
a cookbook is groups together recipes and other info (to be more manageable )

****************
When you don’t specify a resource’s action, Chef applies the default action.
*********
ensures the package is installed, configures the service

*************
*************Write a service Resource that stops and then disables the httpd service from starting when the system boots in Chef.*******
service 'httpd' do
	action [:stop, :disable]
end
***************
Chef-apply is an executable program that runs a single Recipe from the command line. It is a part of the Chef development kit and a great way to explore resources.
********************
run-list lets you specify which Recipes to run, and the order in which to run them. The run-list is important when you have multiple Cookbooks, and the order in which they run matters.
*******************
How do you apply an updated Cookbook to your node in Chef?*************
Run knife ssh from your workstation.
SSH directly into your server and run chef-client.
You can also run chef-client as a daemon, or service, to check in with the Chef server on a regular interval, say every 15 or 30 minutes.
**************

**************** What is the role of Starter Kit in Chef?*************
Starter Kit will create the necessary configuration files like chef directory, knife.rb, the ORGANIZATION-validator.pem, and USER.pem files etc. with the correct information that is required to interact with the Chef server.

Now tell how to use Starter Kit, you can simply download the starter kit and then move it to the desired location on your workstation.
