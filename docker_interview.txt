Docker is a containerization platform which packages your application and all its dependencies together

Unlike Virtual Machines which has its own OS, Docker containers uses the host OS  

Docker image is the source of Docker container. In other words, Docker images are used to create containers. Images are created with the build command

Docker containers include the application and all of its dependencies, but share the kernel with other containers, running as isolated processes in user space on the host operating system

Docker hub is a cloud-based registry service which allows you to link to code repositories, build your images and test them, stores manually pushed images,


it makes it easy for developers to quickly create, ready-to-run containerized applications and it makes managing and deploying applications much easier. You can even share containers with your applications.

any tool that already communicates with a Docker daemon can use Swarm to transparently scale to multiple hosts.

Docker can build images automatically by reading the instructions from a Dockerfile.

A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image. Using docker build users can create an automated build that executes several command-line instructions in succession.
docker-compose -f docker-compose.json up
//to use json for compose file

docker run -t -i
docker ps -a
docker stop container ID
docker restart container ID
